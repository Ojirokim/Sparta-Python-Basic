# Day 9 — Python & SQL
📅 2026-01-14

Today is **Day 9 of my  learning journey**.  

This post is written mainly for myself, but it may also help other beginners.

## Python: `__main__.Person` Explained

### What `__main__.Person` Means
- `Person` is a **class**
- `__main__` is the **module name**
- Together, `__main__.Person` means:
  > The class `Person` defined in the file that is currently being run

---

### What is `__main__`?
- Every Python file is a **module**
- If a file is run directly:
  - Python sets its module name to `__main__`
- If a file is imported:
  - The module name is the filename

---

### Example: Run Directly
```python
# person.py
class Person:
    pass

p = Person()
print(type(p))
```

## Classes vs Instances in Python

### What a Class Is
- A **class** is a blueprint or template
- It defines:
  - What data an object will have (attributes)
  - What actions it can perform (methods)
- Example:
  ```python
  class Person:
      def __init__(self, name, age):
          self.name = name
          self.age = age


## Python Classes, Instances, Dictionaries & Internals — Summary

### Name Mangling (__attribute)
Attributes starting with __ (but not ending with __) are name-mangled
Rule:
```python
__x  →  _ClassName__x
# Example:
self.__balance  →  self._BankAccount__balance
```

### Purpose of Name Mangling
NOT security
NOT true privacy
It exists to:
Prevent accidental access
Avoid attribute collisions in subclasses
You can still access it intentionally

### Accessing Mangled Attributes
If you forget the mangled name:
```python
instance.__dict__
```
This shows the actual stored attribute names
