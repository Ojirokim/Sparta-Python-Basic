## Python: `__main__.Person` Explained

### What `__main__.Person` Means
- `Person` is a **class**
- `__main__` is the **module name**
- Together, `__main__.Person` means:
  > The class `Person` defined in the file that is currently being run

---

### What is `__main__`?
- Every Python file is a **module**
- If a file is run directly:
  - Python sets its module name to `__main__`
- If a file is imported:
  - The module name is the filename

---

### Example: Run Directly
```python
# person.py
class Person:
    pass

p = Person()
print(type(p))
```

## Classes vs Instances in Python

### What a Class Is
- A **class** is a blueprint or template
- It defines:
  - What data an object will have (attributes)
  - What actions it can perform (methods)
- Example:
  ```python
  class Person:
      def __init__(self, name, age):
          self.name = name
          self.age = age
