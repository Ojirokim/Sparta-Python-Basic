# Day 14 — Python & SQL

📅 2026-01-21

Today is **Day 14 of my learning journey**.

This post is written mainly for myself, but it may also help other beginners.

## CodeKata question 61 python

### collections.Counter(iterable)

Counter is a subclass of dict that stores a count of each element.

## CodeKata question 62 python

### replace(substring, replacement)

replace can change all of the occurrences of substring with replacement.
replace can also be used to remove substrings by providing an empty string as replacement.

### if any(bad in w for bad in bad_words)

if any() returns True if any of the elements in the iterable are true.
if any() returns False if all of the elements in the iterable are false.

## Line Plot vs Scatter Plot — When to Use Each

### Key Difference (One Sentence)

- **Scatter plots** show the *relationship* between two variables.
- **Line plots** show how a variable *changes over an ordered axis* (usually time).

---
### Scatter Plot

**Purpose:** Examine association between two variables  
**Order matters?**  No  
**Continuity implied?**  No

**Best for:**

- Correlation (positive / negative / none)
- Clusters
- Outliers
- Nonlinear relationships

**Typical examples:**

- Height vs weight
- Price vs demand
- Study hours vs exam score

**Question answered:**
> “Are these two variables related?”

---
### Line Plot

**Purpose:** Show change over an ordered variable  
**Order matters?**  Yes  
**Continuity implied?**  Yes

**Best for:**

- Trends over time
- Growth or decline
- Seasonality
- Rates of change

**Typical examples:**

- Daily sales over time
- Temperature by hour
- Stock prices

**Question answered:**
> “How does this variable evolve?”

---
### Why Both Show “Relationships”

- Both plot **y vs x**
- Difference is **interpretation**, not mechanics

| Plot Type | Relationship Meaning             |
|-----------|----------------------------------|
| Scatter   | Statistical association          |
| Line      | Sequential / temporal dependence |

---
### Simple Decision Rule
> **If you shuffle the x-axis and the plot still makes sense → Scatter plot**  
> **If it stops making sense → Line plot**

---

### Important Note
- **Line plots imply interpolation between points**
- **Scatter plots do not**

Use scatter for independent observations,  
use line plots when continuity matters.

## Group by
When using group by pandas will exclude rows where columns you group on are NaN from the grouping.
