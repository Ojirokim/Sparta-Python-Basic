## Sampling Distribution
Standard error (SE) of the mean is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample mean.
=> Standard error is standard deviation of sample means
Can also be calculated using the formula below.
If you know the standard deviation of the population: σ / √n
If you do not know the standard deviation of the population: s / √n
(where s is the sample standard deviation)



## Testing methods
Z-test
When you know the population standard deviation, you can use the Z-test.
```python
z_score = (xbar-mu_0)/(sigma/np.sqrt(n))
p_value = stats.norm.sf(z_score)
```
t-test
When you do not know the population standard deviation, you can use the t-test.
```python

```


## One-Sample t-test vs. Cohen’s d

1) One-sample t-statistic
Formula:
t = (x̄ − μ₀) / (s / √n)

- Uses standard error (s / √n)
- Depends on sample size (n)
- Used for hypothesis testing
- Tells you whether the mean difference is statistically significant

2) One-sample Cohen’s d
Formula:
d = (x̄ − μ₀) / s

- Uses sample standard deviation (s)
- Does NOT directly depend on n
- Used for effect size
- Tells you how large the difference is in standardized units

3) Relationship

t = d × √n
d = t / √n

Key Difference
t-statistic → statistical significance
Cohen’s d → practical magnitude

4) Rule of Thumb for d
0.2 → small
0.5 → medium
0.8 → large


## TTestPower(Solve Power)

1) One-Sample and Paired t-test
```python
from statsmodels.stats.power import TTestPower
# Effect size:
d = mean_difference / sd_difference
# Sample size:
n = number of pairs
```

2) Independent Two-Sample t-test
```python
analysis.power(
    effect_size=0.5,
    nobs1=50,
    alpha=0.05,
    ratio=1.0,
    alternative='two-sided'
)
# effect_size → Cohen’s d (standardized difference)
# nobs1 → sample size of group 1
# ratio → n2 / n1 (1.0 means equal groups)
# alpha → significance level
# alternative → 'two-sided', 'larger', or 'smaller'
```
