# Day 3 — Python & SQL
📅 2026-01-07

Today is **Day 3 of my  learning journey**.  

This post is written mainly for myself, but it may also help other beginners.

## What CAST(value AS UNSIGNED) does in MySQL
CAST(value AS UNSIGNED) tells MySQL to treat a value as a non-negative integer.
- When casting, MySQL:
Parses the value as a number
Removes leading zeros
Stops reading at the first non-numeric character
Returns an integer ≥ 0
Example:
```mysql
SELECT CAST('01' AS UNSIGNED);   -- 1
SELECT CAST('002' AS UNSIGNED);  -- 2
SELECT CAST('14' AS UNSIGNED);   -- 14
```
Useful when converting numeric strings like '01', '02', '14' into integers.

⚠️ Note: Negative values wrap around to a large number because UNSIGNED cannot store negatives.
```mysql
CAST(col AS SIGNED)   -- allows negatives
CAST(col AS DECIMAL)  -- preserves decimals
```


## Python conditional expression (A if x else B)
Python supports a conditional expression (often called a ternary operator) with the form:
```python
A if x else B
```

How it works:
```python
## If x is truthy, the expression evaluates to A
## If x is falsy, the expression evaluates to B
```
The condition x is not required to be True or False.
Python evaluates x using truthiness rules.

Common falsy values include:
- False
- 0, 0.0
- "" (empty string)
- [], {} (empty collections)
- None

All other values are considered truthy (including negative numbers).
This expression is equivalent to:
```python
if x:
    result = A
else:
    result = B
```
Use conditional expressions for simple, readable decisions, but prefer a full if statement when the logic becomes complex.


## Why pass exists
Python enforces indentation-based blocks. 
This means constructs like if, for, while, def, and class must contain at least one statement.

Without pass, this would be a syntax error:
```python
if condition:
    # nothing here → SyntaxError
```
Using pass makes the block valid:
```python
if condition:
    pass
```

### pass vs continue vs return
continue skips to the next loop iteration
```python
for i in range(3):
    if i == 1:
        pass
    print(i)
```
```python
for i in range(3):
    if i == 1:
        continue
    print(i)
```
return can only be used inside a function(def)
If this code is just sitting in a script (at the top level), Python will raise a SyntaxError: 'return' outside function.
※ break is used to exit a loop.
