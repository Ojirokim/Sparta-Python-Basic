## What CAST(value AS UNSIGNED) does in MySQL
CAST(value AS UNSIGNED) tells MySQL to treat a value as a non-negative integer.
- When casting, MySQL:
Parses the value as a number
Removes leading zeros
Stops reading at the first non-numeric character
Returns an integer ≥ 0
Example:
```mysql
SELECT CAST('01' AS UNSIGNED);   -- 1
SELECT CAST('002' AS UNSIGNED);  -- 2
SELECT CAST('14' AS UNSIGNED);   -- 14
```
Useful when converting numeric strings like '01', '02', '14' into integers.

⚠️ Note: Negative values wrap around to a large number because UNSIGNED cannot store negatives.
```mysql
CAST(col AS SIGNED)   -- allows negatives
CAST(col AS DECIMAL)  -- preserves decimals
```
