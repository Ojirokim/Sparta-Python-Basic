# Day 7 — Python & SQL
📅 2026-01-12

Today is **Day 7 of my  learning journey**.  

This post is written mainly for myself, but it may also help other beginners.

## dict.fromkeys()
dict is a built-in class in Python.
fromkeys() is a class method of dict.
It creates and returns a new dictionary.
Keys come from an iterable.
All keys are assigned the same value (default is None).
Duplicate keys are automatically removed.
Dictionaries preserve insertion order, so order is kept.
Common use case: remove duplicates while preserving order.
```python
unique_items = list(dict.fromkeys(items))
```
⚠️ If the value is mutable (like a list), all keys share the same object.


## list.sort()
sort() is an instance method of the list class.
It sorts the list in place (modifies the original list).
It returns None.
Default sorting order is ascending.
### Works only on lists (not tuples or other iterables).
```python
numbers = [3, 1, 4, 2]
numbers.sort()
```

### Common Parameters
```python
list.sort(key=None, reverse=False)
```
key → function applied to each element before sorting
reverse=True → sorts in descending order

### Example:
```python
words = ["banana", "Apple", "cherry"]
words.sort(key=str.lower)
```

### Important Details
Sorting is stable (equal elements keep their relative order).
Time complexity: O(n log n).
Elements must be comparable.

### This causes an error:
```python
[1, "a"].sort()
```

### Common Mistake
```python
sorted_list = my_list.sort()  # ❌ sorted_list is None
## Correct:
my_list.sort()
```


## set()
set is a built-in class in Python.
A set stores unique elements only (no duplicates).
Sets are unordered (no indexing, no guaranteed order).
Membership checks (in) are very fast.
Sets are mutable (you can add/remove items).
```python
nums = set([1, 2, 2, 3])
# {1, 2, 3}
```

### Key Properties
Duplicate values are automatically removed
Elements must be hashable (immutable)
Cannot access items by index (set[0] ❌)

### Important Notes
Order is not preserved
{} creates a dict, not a set
Use set() to create an empty set


## Dictionary Initialization
A dictionary must be initialized before use:
```python
d={}
```
Simple values (int, str, bool, etc.) do not need pre-initialization.
Mutable values (list, dict, set) must be initialized before modifying.
```python
# Error
d[key].append(x)

# Correct
if key not in d:
    d[key] = []
d[key].append(x)
```
Reason: mutable values must exist before mutation.
Best tools to avoid manual initialization:
#### dict.setdefault()
```python
groups = {}
for word in words:
    groups.setdefault(word, []).append(word)
```
#### collections.defaultdict
```python
from collections import defaultdict
groups = defaultdict(list)
for word in words:
    groups[word].append(word)
```


## Random Module
### 1) `random.randint(a, b)`
returns a random integer from a to b (both inclusive)
```python
import random
n = random.randint(1, 10)
print(n)   # Any integer between 1 and 10
```
Caution: randint() includes the upper bound.

### 2) `random.random()`
Returns a random float between 0.0 and 1.0
```python
import random
x = random.random()
print(x)   # Ex: 0.3849201
```

---

### 3) `random.choice(list)`
Picks a random element from a list
```python
import random
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
print(random.choice(fruits))
```
