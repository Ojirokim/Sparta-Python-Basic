# Day 5 — Python & SQL
📅 2026-01-08

Today is **Day 5 of my  learning journey**.  

This post is written mainly for myself, but it may also help other beginners.

## Python List
### Insert, Append in Python
Append is used to add an element to the end of a list.
Insert is used to add an element at a specified position in a list.
Extend is used to add the elements of a list (or any iterable)
```python
list.append(element)
list.insert(index, element)
list.extend(iterable)
```

### Remove,Pop in Python
remove() method removes the first specified element from the list.
pop() method removes the element at the specified position in the list.
clear() method empties the list of all elements.

### Sorting in Python
sort() method sorts the list in ascending order.
reverse() method reverses the order of the list.
```python
list.sort()
list.reverse()
list.sort(reverse=True)
```

## Lists vs NumPy Arrays (Matrix Topic)
### What a “matrix” is in Python:
Python has no built-in matrix type
A “matrix” is usually represented as:
[[1, 2, 3],
 [4, 5, 6]]
This is a list of lists, used to represent a matrix

### List of lists
Nested Python objects (list inside list)
Rows are independent objects
Can be jagged (non-rectangular)
Slower for numerical operations

Indexing
```python
lst[i][j]   # get row, then column

# Printing
[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
```

### NumPy array
A single multidimensional object (ndarray)
Fixed rectangular shape
One data type (homogeneous)
Stored in contiguous memory → fast math
```python
import numpy as np
arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                [4, 5, 6]])
arr[i, j]
# can also use arr[i][j]
```

### Printing difference
```python
[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]  # list of lists

[[1 2 3]    # NumPy array
 [4 5 6]]
```

# Conversions
```python
np.array(lst)  # list to array
arr.tolist() # array to list
```
